Decorator Pattern => Structural Design Pattern => "alows adding new behaviors to object dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects called decorators"

Problem Statement => 
1) You want to offer other types of toppings as well
2) Users may want multiple toppings at once
3) Even having 3 toppings increases the number of combinations of 8

Solution =>
We can create a decorator/wrapper class that can be customized to meet specific needs. 
Object of this class can use the behaviour of various classes, having references to multiple objects and delegating them all kinds of work
