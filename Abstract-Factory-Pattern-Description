Abstract Factory Pattern => Creation Design Pattern => "Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes"


Problem Statement =>
"Imagine that you are at a restraunt and want to order food and don't care about the specifics as long as its veg.
Each member in group will have veg automatically when one member will say veg and same for non veg. Here each order needs to be automatically set"


Solution => 
"
Waiter acts as a food proivder and chef act as a food factories.
They create food and provides to client without worrying about the specifics.
The waiter remembers your preference and uses it for all food items.
In future, if the restraunt changes anything in food preparation process you don't need to change the order.
